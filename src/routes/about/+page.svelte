			I grew up fascinated by computers and technology, spending countless hours exploring how things work. This curiosity led me to pursue a degree in Information Technology, where I have been able to deepen my knowledge in areas such as software development, networking, and cybersecurity. My education at Gordon College has equipped me with the skills necessary to tackle real-world challenges and embrace the ever-evolving tech landscape.

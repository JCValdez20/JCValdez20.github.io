        Hello, I'm John Christian V. Valdez, an Information Technology student at Gordon College. I am passionate about technology, games, and designing.
      </p>
      <p>
        At a very young age, I grew to love drawing and designing different things and projects. As I grew up, I discovered technology, games, and designing sites and logos. I think that is what led me here to Information Technology.
      </p>
      <p>
        I believe that my experiences in Information Technology will help me live a life that I can be proud of.
